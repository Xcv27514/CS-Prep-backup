# CS-Prep-backup

Test your understanding of under the hood JavaScript concepts like higher order 
functions and closure
● The joy of building from total scratch an app/game that you built every last piece 
of as a group
● Focusing on legitimate problem solving (not HTML/CSS

Use plain/vanilla JavaScript (i.e. no libraries like jQuery, and 
no HTML/CSS)
○ Fully focus on problem-solving using what we’ve 
learned over the past two weeks
● Aim to use the concepts of higher order functions, closure in 
some way (although don’t make this the number one goal)
What can we build?
● Examples: text-adventure games, trivia games, card games 
(blackjack, poker), tools for storing algorithm questions and 
answers, to do list, ...anything you want!
